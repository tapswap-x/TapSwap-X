TapSwap X is a free autoclicker for fast mining in the [TapSwap bot](https://t.me/tapswap_mirror_2_bot?start=r_1769904332). In addition, he is also able to identify and easily shows the colored borders of buildings: what is improving, what can be improved, what cannot be improved and what is already at the maximum level. And a less important change, it redraws the colors of the main menu to a gray TapSwap X theme
